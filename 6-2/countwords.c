/* Exercise 6-2. Write a program that reads a C program and prints in
 * alphabetical order each group of variable names that are identical in the
 * first 6 characters, but different somewhere thereafter. Donâ€™t count words
 * within strings and comments. Make 6 a parameter that can be set from the
 * command line.
 *
 * We need to avoid comments first.
 * Then detect "variable names" via declaration
 *
 * Question:
 *  Do we group them in data structure, or only as we print them?
 * A:
 *  I think we can store them all and separate into groups while printing
 *
 * What do they mean by "groups?"
 *
 *   hello
 *
 *   goodbye
 *   goodbyeworld
